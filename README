FORKED
This is a fork of Munin-Mobile to support Munin 1.4.6 (and to make it work with ubuntu as a bonus).

It uses the code from VvanGemert fork for 1.4.5, that is pretty good, but not enought to run in 1.4.6

Munin Mobile
By: Niklas Bivald

INTRODUCTION
Munin Mobile is a mobile template for Munin, using jquery-mobile. This allows
your Munin installations to be easily monitored with your smartphone.

Munin Mobile is initially made for the Munin debian package (1.2.6). Currently
I haven't tested any other versions.

Both Munin Mobile and jquery-mobile are a bit rough (jQuery Mobile is alpha!)
and before you tell me that this could be made without jQuery Mobile using just
special CSS: Yes, it could. But this is just as much exploring jQuery Mobile
as it is exploring Munin.

We're hooking into munin-html with a custom configuration file, hopefully making
it as "Munin-friendly" as possible.

INSTALL
Assuming you have the standard debian package (/etc/munin, /var/www/munin) you
*should* just be able to run the ./install.sh script. This will install templates
and configuration file (which you might want to check out)

We also need to make Munin create the job that regularly updates the HTML. In the
future we will hook it into Munin itself, but for now, use this crontab from your
Munin user:

# m h  dom mon dow   command
*/5 * * * * /etc/munin/update-mobile.sh

After installation, you should have a mobile-subfolder in your munin
(yourdomain.com/munin/mobile).

DEPENDENCIES
None

IMAGE RESIZING
Previous versions resized all images using mogrify. If you still want to do this,
simply "apt-get install imagemagick" and uncomment the last line of update-mobile.sh
